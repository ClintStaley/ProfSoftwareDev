<h1>Build Tools Exercises</h1>
<h2 class="western">Maven</h2>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Look up build
	tools Ant and Gradle. How do they compare with Maven as far as what
	they cover, and their ease of use?</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Check out the
	main Maven repository at https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/  About how
	many packages have &quot;commons&quot; as a prefix, for instance? 
	How many people, roughly, contributed as developers to the junit
	module?  How about just &quot;contributors&quot; (often people who
	fix a small bug).  What contribution did SeriyBg make, for instance?</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Create a
	Maven project from scratch, able to compile the provided Sample.java
	file.  Submit the pom.xml file.</p>
</ol>
<h2 class="western">WebPack</h2>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Look up Sass,
	an extension CSS language. Write a small Sass file as part of the
	webpack-example, doing one example of CSS inheritance. Use it in the
	app, and adjust webpack.config.js to load it properly. (Note that
	Sass is server-side compiled.)</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Write a small
	markdown file, include it in index.html, and display it as the
	innerHTML of the main div. Here again, adjust webpack.config.js to
	load the MD file.</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Look up
	devtool options for webpack, and run a webpack with devtool
	cheap-module-source-map.  Beautify the resultant bundle.js,
	installing js-beautify if you haven't already.  Examine the 
	bundle.js code, finding at least three lines that are designed for
	DI.</p>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<h2 class="western">Make</h2>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p>Write a makefile that properly expresses dependencies for
	the .c and .h files provided.  Provide two target executables: dev
	and prod.  The former provides debugging flag -g and does not
	optimize.  The latter omits -g and optimizes.  Test your makefile by
	&quot;touch&quot;ing various .h and .c files and watching how it
	rebuilds the project.  Submit this as myMakeFile.</p>
	<li/>
<p>Remove the header file dependency section from your
	makefile, and instead read up on and use makedepend to generate the
	header files.  Do you end up with the same dependencies?</p>
</ol>
