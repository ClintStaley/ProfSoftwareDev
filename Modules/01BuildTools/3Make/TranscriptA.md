#Make

##Big picture
  * Old-school system still used on Unix platforms.
  * Controls project build and release tasks.  No package management.
  * Somewhat cranky syntax

## Example makefile

  * makefile or Makefile is the rough equivalent of pom.xml, but w/o package management
  * Text file (note odd tabbed-indent requirement)
  * Example file
    * variables
    * .cpp/.o targets
    * Build targets
    * Header dependencies
    * Generalized dependencies
    * Brief intro to makedepend
