<h1 class="western">Testing Exercise</h1>
<p>1. Describe three different examples of software systems where
writing testing code may be more of an effort than writing the
software itself.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>2. Describe the relationship between whitebox fuzzing and code
coverage.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>3. Read up on the Istanbul code coverage tool, and its &quot;nyc&quot;
command.  Install istanbul and use the nyc command to start up the
REST server.  Then drive the server with the current Postman suite to
develop code coverage data.  Upon termination of the server, you
should see a code coverage dump.   
</p>
<p>From this dump, pick any file with at least three different blocks
of uncovered code, improve the Postman suite to cover this code, and
verify coverage by rerunning the nyc code coverage tool with the
improved Postman suite driving the REST server.  Commit the improved
suite to master.  (Coordinate this with other students to avoid
colliding Postman modifications.)</p>
<p>4. What is the most common unit testing tool for Java?  Briefly,
how do you write unit tests under this tool?  (Provide a small
example unit test.)</p>
<p>5. Read up on the Mocha unit testing tool for JS, and install it. 
Create a test directory under RESTServer and write a
Validator.test.js file to provide unit tests for the Validator.js
module.  First run the unit tests directly using Mocha.  Then run
them under instanbul, and verify that the tests provide full code
coverage of Validator.js.</p>
