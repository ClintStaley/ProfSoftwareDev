<h2 class="western">Overview</h2>
<p class="western">In this lecture we'll look at the requirements of
clear writing on STEM topics. 
</p>
<h2 class="western">First, the Obvious</h2>
<p class="western">We've talked already about:</p>
<p class="text-body-nospace-western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">the
STEM learnng curve</p>
<p class="text-body-nospace-western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">the
value of starting with concrete examples</p>
<p class="text-body-nospace-western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">the
importance of good diagrams and visualizations</p>
<p class="text-body-nospace-western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">the
importance of using consistent terminology and coining new terms when
appropriate</p>
<p class="text-body-nospace-western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">choosing
the right sequence of concepts</p>
<p class="text-body-nospace-western" style="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0.2in">
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western">All of these apply just as much to written
explanation as to spoken. Start your written explanations with
concrete examples, perhaps after a motivating rationale, use diagrams
in the document when needed, use consistent terminology (STEM writing
does <i>not</i><span style="font-variant: normal"> </span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">frown
on repeating the same words, unlike other forms of writing), coin
terms, sequence carefully, etc.</span></span></p>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">We
won't talk more on these, since we've covered them in prior lectures,
and what we said then applies, without change, to STEM writing.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Writing
vs Speaking</h2>
<p class="western"><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">Writing
is a more demanding medium than speaking. We are wired to speak and
listen &ndash; humanity has been doing it for tens of thousands of
years. We're not as instinctively good and writing and reading, since
most of humanity has been doing those for only a couple of centuries.
Things you can get away with in spoken form will not work in written
form, because writing lacks the additional bandwidth of tone,
cadence, and facial expression, and the general forgiveness we offer
as listeners vs readers. (If you doubt that latter, try</span></span>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">reading
a literal transcript of a spoken conversation &ndash; it will sound
awkward, ambiguous, and ill phrased, even it it sounded fine in
spoken form.)</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">But,
of course, writing has advantages. Written material is available to
the student at any time, and the reader can absorb the material at
his own pace, going slower or faster, and rereading as needed. The
opportunity to read quickly is a particular plus. Most people can
read much faster than anyone can speak, and indeed even faster than
they could </span></span><i>listen</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">to
sped-up speech. In computer terms, written material offers the
highest input bandwidth. And if the document is well organized, the
reader can use it in random-access mode, jumping directly to points
of interest. </span></span>
</p>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">As
we'll discuss in a later lecture, online podcasts offer some of these
advantages, but even they cannot match the random-access of a written
work and its high input bandwidth.</p>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">So,
with particular attention to STEM writing, how do we work around the
disadvantages of written communication in order to get those
advantages?</p>
<h2 class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Avoid
Ambiguity</h2>
<p class="western">&ldquo;<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">Avoid
ambiguity&rdquo; is always good advice, of course. But here are some
particular points to watch for in STEM writing.</span></span></p>
<h4 class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Watch
out for Pronouns</h4>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Pronouns
like &ldquo;it&rdquo;, &ldquo;that&rdquo;, etc invite trouble.
Technical prose is &ldquo;noun rich&rdquo; -- it usually discusses
several things at the same time, and pronouns are thus usually
ambiguous. An example:</p>
<p class="western">&ldquo;<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">In
this linked list algorithm, we advance the pointer </span></span><i>temp</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">from
the first node to the second, and then check to see if it has
nonnegative data.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">What
does &ldquo;it&rdquo; refer to in that sentence? &ldquo;It&rdquo;
could be the first node or the second. Even if the reader can guess
which you mean, they're left with a nagging feeling that they might
have been wrong. Unless a pronoun is clearly unambiguous, replace it
with the noun to which it refers: &ldquo;.. to see if </span></span><i>the
second node</i><span style="font-variant: normal"> </span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">has
nonnegative data&rdquo;.</span></span></p>
<h3 class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Word
Choice</h3>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Seemingly
unimportant shifts in choice of wording can make a big difference in
clarity, again more so in written than in spoken communication. And,
as with avoiding ambiguous pronouns, even if the reader can figure
out what you mean, it's still more restful and confidence-engendering
for them if you are totally clear. Some examples:</p>
<p class="western">&ldquo;<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">Use
malloc to allocate a pointer to a block of data&rdquo; vs &ldquo;Use
malloc to allocate a block of data.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">The
second is correct. Malloc doesn't allocate a pointer. It allocates
the data to which the pointer refers.</p>
<p class="western">&ldquo;<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">We
shift the bits down by three positions&rdquo; vs &ldquo;We shift the
bits to the right by three positions&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">The
second again is better. &ldquo;Down&rdquo; is almost a synonym for
&ldquo;over&rdquo; in this context &ndash; it doesn't imply a clear
direction. &ldquo;To the right&rdquo; leaves no ambiguity, assuming
you're drawing the bits in the usual way.</p>
<p class="western">&ldquo;<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">We
move the value from i to j&rdquo; vs &ldquo;We copy the value from i
to j&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Moving
implies somehow that the value is no longer in i, but of course it's
in both i and j. The second form makes that clearer.</p>
<h3 class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Phrase
Order</h3>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Watch
the order in which you place several prepositional phrases or other
modifying clauses. Cases in which a modifying phrase might apply to
two different subjects often occur in normal writing, and modest
instances are acceptable because the intent is almost always clear
from context. Not so in STEM prose, where the concepts are more
complex, and multiple interpretations are possible. For instance:</p>
<p class="western">&ldquo;<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">Stop
the thread in the process that was running&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Did
you mean 
</p>
<p class="western">&ldquo;<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">Stop
the thread that was running in the process&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Stop the
thread in the running process&rdquo;?</span></span></p>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Here's
another:</p>
<p class="western">&ldquo;<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">The
algorithm prints the last variable in the array that was entered.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Hmm.
Did you mean:</p>
<p class="western">&ldquo;<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">The
algorithm prints the last variable that was entered in the array&rdquo;,
or &ldquo;From the array that was entered, the algorithm prints the
last variable&rdquo;?</span></span></p>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">There's
always some way to combine the phrases unambiguously, even if it
takes two sentences. Be sure to do this.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Conciseness</h2>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">As
the old saying goes, &ldquo;Brevity is the soul of wit.&rdquo;
Conciseness and elegance are the mark of good STEM writing (and of
good STEM work in general). There's no exact rule for how to do this,
of course. But, reviewing what you've written to tighten it up is the
most important step -- see Revise and Edit below.</p>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal"><b>Nonconcise
example:</b></p>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">A
for-loop is a loop that is like a while loop, but also has two added
parts in the for-loop header to go along with the loop test. The
for-loop header has the following form:</p>
<pre class="western">for (initializer; loop test; incrementer)
   loop body;</pre><p class="western">
<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">The
first added part, the </span></span><i>initializer</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">,
is performed one time before the loop starts, and the second added
part, the </span></span><i>incrementer</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">,
lets you do an increment of a loop variable or other action after
each of the loop's iterations.</span></span></p>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">The
loop test works just like the loop test in a while-loop; the for-loop
continues to run as long as the test is true. But, the initializer,
despite being right next to the loop test, is run only once, before
the loop starts. The incrementer is done each time the loop runs,
though conceptually it is done at the bottom of the loop body, as
essentially a final step in the loop body before returning to the top
of the loop. (This can be a little confusing since the incrementer is
written at the top of the loop in the header, but it's actually done
at the bottom of the loop.) If you were to rewrite a for-loop as a
while loop instead, this is what you'd do:</p>
<pre class="western">initializer;
while (loop test) {
   loop body;
   incrementer;
}</pre><p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">
<b>Concise example:</b></p>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
A for-loop works like a while-loop, but with two added parts to its
header:</p>
<pre class="western">for (initializer; loop test; incrementer)
   loop body;</pre><p class="text-body-nospace-western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">
<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">Like
a while-loop, the for-loop continues to run as long as its loop test
is true. But, the </span></span><i>initializer</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">runs
just once, before the loop starts. And, even though it's written at
the top of the loop, the </span></span><i>incrementer</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">actually
runs at the end of each loop iteration. (Don't be confused by its
location &ndash; it runs at the </span></span><i>end</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">of
each iteration.) The for-loop is thus equivalent to this while-loop:</span></span></p>
<p class="text-body-nospace-western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<pre class="western">initializer;
while (loop test) {
   loop body;
   incrementer;
}</pre><p class="text-body-nospace-western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">
The nonconcise example comprises 202 words; the concise one has 85
words.</p>
<h4 class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Enthusiasm
Adverbs</h4>
<p class="western"><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">A
non-concise writing habit peculiar to engineers is the use of what
might be termed </span></span><i>enthusiasm adverbs</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">:
&ldquo;basically&rdquo;, &ldquo;fundamentally&rdquo;, &ldquo;essentially&rdquo;,
and the like. For instance:</span></span></p>
<p class="western">&ldquo;<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">Basically,
a linked list is a chain of nodes. Traversing the list is essentially
a matter of moving a pointer from node to node down the list.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">The
&ldquo;basically&rdquo; and &ldquo;essentially&rdquo; add no meaning,
and perhaps worse, they make the writer sound like a breathlessly
enthusiastic geek. Drop them.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Passive
Voice</h2>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Passive
voice sentences, for those not into grammar, are sentences framed
without a clear subject &ndash; just a verb and direct object. For
instance:</p>
<p class="western"><i>The array is traversed until the desired
element is found.</i></p>
<p class="western"><i>The head pointer is initialized to null.</i></p>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">While
&ldquo;array&rdquo;, &ldquo;element&rdquo;, and &ldquo;head pointer&rdquo;
appear at the start of these sentences or phrases, they are not
subjects &ndash; not the doers of the action. They're actually direct
objects &ndash; things upon which the action is done. The subject is
omitted altogether, as though the traversing, finding, and
initializing are just magically happening. 
</p>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">English
allows passive voice structure so that you can describe subjectless
actions, and it is sometimes useful. As a humorous example, it's
great for avoiding blame: &ldquo;The package was dropped and the item
was broken.&rdquo; (No particular person did this, of course...)</p>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">But,
engineers and bureaucrats are notorious for overusing passive voice,
perhaps because they feel it sounds formal and proper. The sentence
structure has two major drawbacks. First, it's boring, especially if
used in sentence after sentence. Second, it communicates less
information since it lacks a clear subject. Consider these active
voice rewrites of the sentences above:</p>
<p class="western"><i>The first loop traverses the array until the
if-statement finds the desired element.</i></p>
<p class="western"><i>The declaration initializes the head pointer to
null.</i></p>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">They
convey more information, and are more &ldquo;lively&rdquo; and
readable. Passive voice is not always wrong; sometimes there just is
no clear subject. But before you use it, always try first to frame
the sentence in active voice if you reasonably can.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Revise
and Edit</h2>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">There's
a legend that Abraham Lincoln wrote his incomparable Gettysburg
Address on the back of an envelope on the way to the event. Like many
Lincoln legends, this is apocryphal. Lincoln edited and revised the
speech intensively before delivering it. Five different versions
written in his hand survive to this day. (If you love both history
and writing, you should check these out online.)</p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">STEM
writing is not great political oratory, but it benefits from revision
just as much. Almost no one writes clearly and elegantly in a first
draft. In a sense, one might say that good writing </span></span><i>is</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">good
revision. The writing you give your students should never be your
first draft, but rather your Nth draft, after you've considered
different phrase orders, word choices, sequencing, etc, and after
you've removed extraneous words and tightened your prose. </span></span>
</p>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">It's
not the first draft that counts; it's the last.</p>
<h2 class="western">Questions</h2>
<p class="western">1. Write a description of insertion sort, with any
attendant diagram you need, assuming the reader already understands
101 level Java. Edit it until you're confident it meets all the
requirements of good STEM teaching in general from prior lectures,
and all the points on STEM writing from this lecture. Place your
document in a web-accessible location, for class review and
discussion.</p>
