# Self-Study

## Pick Specific Areas to Study
  1. This may be areas of code you're assigned to fix or improve, or just areas you want to explore
  2. List what you need to better understand (e.g. language, library, software tools)
  3. Seek reference recommendations if available
	1. This will almost always be online content, though on occasion a book is useful for stable content.
  4. Build your own annotated bibliography as you go.
	1. Links and commentary on them.
	2. Design it to be used by others.
        3. Browser bookmarks too
  5. Use SO and similar sites, but cautiously
      1. Tend to overdesign or be too fancy
      2. Don't just blind-copy code snippets -- comprehend them first.
  6. Reading the source base
      1. Step at a time.  You'll never understand *all* of a 1000000 line codebase.
      1. Balance top-down and bottom-up
      1. Make small, temporary mods to the code where useful to understand what it does.
      2. Add comments to the code, but with your initials so they can be checked by more experienced staff
  7. Use existing design docs, but only if they are really up to date.
