# Setup of Codebase

## Read up on Git to understand
 1. Basic repo maintenance: commit, push, pull, config, clone, log, status

## Follow instructions in Startup.md from site
 1. Almost all codebases have such docs
 2. Configuration is often a multiday, multi-hassle process.  Be patient
 3. The docs are almost always slightly out of date due to fast evolution of the project.
	1. Modify them, with OK from team, as needed.  Leave a better doc than you found.
 4. Practical hints:
	 1. Don't be intimidated; this is hard for everyone
	 2. Try to understand *why* you are doing things rather than just following commands.  Helps debugging.
	 3. Don't feel bad about asking questions, but *first* do your best to figure things out yourself, and try to group questions.  Remember your coworkers have other work of their own.
	 4. Do things a step at a time.
