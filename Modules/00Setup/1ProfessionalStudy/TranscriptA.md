# Professional Study

## Overview
Self-study as a professional is different from academic study:
  * Self-driven.  You don't get assignments, or assigned reading, typically.  You figure it out for yourself.
  * Production oriented, not theory oriented

## Practical points
  * List what you need to better understand (e.g. language, library, software tools)
    * This may be areas of code you're assigned to fix or improve, or just areas you want to explore
    * Set small goals related to actual software results.  Modify a feature, fix a bug, set up a config, etc.
  * Rely on web hunts, but
	  * Be careful about *currency* of information, especially in web tools.
	  * Don't rote-copy code; understand what it does (for SO in particular)
	  * Texts can be useful for stable content
  * Build an annotated bibliography as you go.
	  * Links and commentary on them.
	  * Design it to be used by others.
    * Browser bookmarks too
  * Use SO and similar sites, but cautiously
    * Tend to overdesign or be too fancy
    * Don't just blind-copy code snippets -- comprehend them first.
  * Get help from colleagues but:
	  * RTFM first
	  * Group questions, and be sure you've done due diligence to figure it out for yourself.
	  * Don't spin wheels, however.
	  * Write down what you are told so you don't have to ask again

## Keep Learning
  * Easy to settle for enough knowledge to get it working.  Dig deeper especially on important tools/languages
